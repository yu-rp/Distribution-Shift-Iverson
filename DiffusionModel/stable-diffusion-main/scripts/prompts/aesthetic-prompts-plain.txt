A crystal heart
A fleet in the eye of the storm
A storm in a teacup
Day and night fight for the domination of time
Finally, spring reaches the land of never ending winter
Lion, king of beasts
Lush heaven, great of the vows on the cold symphonies
Nature's revolte against the rule of man
The Wizzard of Oz conducting alchemie experiments
The conquest of paradise
The incarnation of mankind's outrages
The sad harlequin
The sun shines from a dark hole
Twilight of the Gods
Two youngsters duelling with swords
a big smile
a broken lightbulb
a carnival of dreams
a castle in the clouds
a cat and a dog in a boxing match
a confused duck
a geeky nerd man wearing AR alternate reality glasses standing with his arms crossed in a translucent sheen of turquoise fog
a lantern in the darkness
a maximalist detailed tokyo city street scene
a snow covered road at night next to a forest of pine trees
a tower made of ivory
a triptych of landscapes hanging on the walls of my mom's kitchen
aliens ridiculing a stupid human
an alien time machine device
an illustration of a chemistry lab in bursting high resolution colors
ancient shinto temple in a forest
artificial general intelligence scheduling mandatory leisure time for humanity
crystalline entity of the 4th dimension
dance of perfection, call such vivid, death is next to such promise of yours
dancing in the waves
dark fantasy cheeseburger
dichroic crystalline holographic representation of emotional power
dynamism of a time machine
extremely colorful fireworks exploding over the puget sound
fat old sun
feeding my art addiction
flip flops on the beach
go to bed already my god
illustration of the earth planet world on fire
magic tree of life
making AI generated images releases too many endorphins, leading to paradoxical dread of unbounded novelty, a children's story book
sleeping on a cloud drifting over the fields and rivers
star seed
stones of eyes in color of hue's of hunts and colors
the angel of eternal life
the carnival will be starting soon, buy your tickets here
the end of the world
the flowers in the meadow flow like water
the grey heavens
the hedonic treadmill
the holy grail filled with the essence of consciousness
the incarnation of mankind's goodwill
the jungle is deep and beautiful
the light at the end of the tunnel
the machine elves dance around my mind
the spirit of competition
the underlying problem
this automobile makes me feel romantically uncomfortable
warp speed
